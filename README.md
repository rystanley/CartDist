# CartDist
Code to re-project marine least-cost distances into Cartesian coordinates.

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/93073704.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/93073704)


![](vignette/CartesianWorkflow.jpg)

Example workflow 1) assemble coordinates in native geographic coordination, 2) calculate least-cost path accounting for land as barrier, 3) calculate 2 dimensional rescaling using metaMDS, 4) compare distances in 2 dimensional rescaling with least-cost distances. Example locations from [Benestan et al. 2016](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.13245/abstract).

# **Installation**

*CartDist* can be sourced into the workspace by cloning this [Github directory](https://github.com/rystanley/CartDist) or by sourcing directly using the web url.

<a name="installation"/>

```r
library(RCurl) # if you do not have the package rcurl installed please load from CRAN.

#links for the 'raw' code
Weblink <- c("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rystanley/CartDist/master/CartDistFunction.R")

#source the 'raw' code links into the local environment
  script <- RCurl::getURL(Weblink, ssl.verifypeer = FALSE)
  eval(parse(text = script),envir=.GlobalEnv)
  rm(script)  

```

# **Output**

## Output is a list object containing:

**Parameter** | **Description**  
--------------|-----------------------------------
*Coords* | Geographic and Cartesian coordinates. 
*fit.plot* | Realized vs projected distance comparision. 
*mod*| Realized vs projected distance model. 
*trans*| A transition object (object from the marmap::trans.mat or the transition object supplied by input parameter 'trans'). 
*lc.dist* | Pairwise dissimilarity (km) among locations in the container provided by marmap::lc.dist.
*bathydata* | Bathymetric data calcaulted for region. 

# **Example use**

**Parameter** | **Input**  
--------------|-----------------------------------
*coordinates* | This .csv file requires at least 3 columns - "Code","Lat", and "Long". Make sure your points are not on land prior to analysis. 
*min.depth* | The minimum depth required to calculate least-cost distances for your species of interest. 
*max.depth*| The minimum depth required to calculate least-cost distances for your species of interest. Can be NULL. 
*trans*| A transition object (object from the marmap::trans.mat). Defualt is NA and will be calcauted. If this has been calculated already it can be included as a workspace object.
*gridres* | The resolution used during marmap's bathymetry calculations. Ranges from 1-4, with 1 being the highest resolution. Note that higher resolutions will take a longer time.
*directory* | The directory you want your results and figures deposited in. 

Re-project example coordinates into cartesian space accounting for land (>0 depth) as a impermeable barrier to dispersal. Note the data used in this example are available [here](https://github.com/rystanley/CartDist/tree/master/exampledata). Locations are derived from RAD sequencing study on European green crab (_Carcinus maenas_) available [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5395438/).


```r

coord_cartesian("exampledata/examplecoordinates.csv", min.depth=-5,max.depth=NULL, gridres=2, directory="~/Desktop/") 

```

An example bathymetry map with points produced by this function using the marmap package [Pante and Simon-Bouhet 2013](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/marmap/index.html)

![](vignette/Cartesian_vs_Geographic_Distances.png)

Example output. Shows a linear model of geographic versus Cartesian least-cost distances among sample sites. A strong positive relationship indicates that that your coordinates were re-projected correctly.


Final output will show your stress (<0.05 is good) and new Cartesian coordinates added to your coordinates input. 

"metaMDS reprojection stress = 0.0097"
